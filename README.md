The goals of project arachne are: 
- to understand key themes and visuals presented from country teams to SGAC (or for internal review)
- to better position ourselves from a HQ standpoint to support our country teams by weaving our own 
pre-generated reports (fitting of the gods) around these key areas to serve as a quick starting place for reviewing program and partner performance
